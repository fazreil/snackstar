# Running jira software
We are going to run jira out of jira-software docker image provided by atlassian <sup>1</sup>.

run the command below to create a jira instance

```
docker volume create --name jiraVolume
docker run -v jiraVolume:/var/atlassian/application-data/jira --name="jira" -d -p 8080:8080 atlassian/jira-software
```

# Running gogs
We are going to run gogs out of gogs docker image provided by gogs <sup>2</sup>

```
docker volume create --name gogsVolume
docker run -v gogsVolume:/data --name=gogs -p 10022:22 -p 10080:3000 -d gogs/gogs
```

# Create gogs user in jira
For now let's call this guy 'gogs'

# Create an issue
Create an issue (task issuetype) and take a look at the issue key.
When I create it, it is called 'SNACK-17'

# Test calling JIRA Rest API
this is the form of curl command to call jira rest api to update comment on SNACK-17. Reference can be found at <sup>3</sup>
```
curl -u gogs:gogs -X POST --data '{ "body" : "test" }' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8080/rest/api/latest/issue/SNACK-17/comment
```
Look at the form of the address, there are:
- rest api module (.../issue/...)
- followed by issue key (.../SNACK-17/...)
- followed by the function name (.../comment)

there is `--data` part where you supply the body of string you like to comment with

the `-u gogs:gogs` specify the authentication to jira in form of `username:password`

# Test calling JIRA Rest API from gogs
Gogs cannot call jira from localhost:8080, instead gogs need to talk to jira through the host's ip:port

determining the host's ip is done by issuing ip addr command. One of the entry looks as below:
```
4: docker0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default
    link/ether 02:42:bd:be:d0:ba brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.17.0.1/16 brd 172.17.255.255 scope global docker0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::42:bdff:febe:d0ba/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

So we need to modify the curl command to the following:
```
curl -u gogs:gogs -X POST --data '{ "body" : "hello from gogs" }' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://172.17.0.1:8080/rest/api/latest/issue/SNACK-17/comment
```

# modify git hook to call JIRA Rest API
Original git hook for post-update looks like this:
```
#!/bin/sh
#
# An example hook script for the "post-receive" event.
#
# The "post-receive" script is run after receive-pack has accepted a pack
# and the repository has been updated.  It is passed arguments in through
# stdin in the form
#  <oldrev> <newrev> <refname>
# For example:
#  aa453216d1b3e49e7f6f98441fa56946ddcd6a20 68f7abf4e6f922807889f52bc043ecd31b79f814 refs/heads/master

while read oldrev newrev refname
do
    branch=$(git rev-parse --symbolic --abbrev-ref $refname)
    if [ "master" = "$branch" ]; then
        # Do something
    fi
    #$(git log -1 --pretty=format:'%h %cn: %s%b' $newrev)
    commitmsg = $(git log -1 --oneline)
done
```

(todo)

## extract the first 7 characters in a hash
Reference <sup>4</sup>
```
export testhash=afdda35ce0c93adb56252ce95544450494cd0b0a
echo $testhash | awk '{print substr($0,0,7)}'
```

## getting the commit message from refname

`$refname` is defined as one of the parameter that spells out the branch where the commit comes from /ref/head/master

in order to get the branch, use the following command:
```
git rev-parse --symbolic --abbrev-ref $refname
```
to get the latest commit message from the said branch, use git log -1 --oneline. Specify the branch using the command above to get latest commit out of the said branch

```
commitmsg=$(git log -1 --oneline --no-merges $(git rev-parse --symbolic --abbrev-ref $refname))
```

## modified post-update git hook looks like this:
```
#!/bin/sh
#
# An example hook script for the "post-receive" event.
#
# The "post-receive" script is run after receive-pack has accepted a pack
# and the repository has been updated.  It is passed arguments in through

while read oldrev newrev refname
do
    branch=$(git rev-parse --symbolic --abbrev-ref $refname)
    commitmsg=$(git log -1 --oneline --no-merges $branch)
    jiramsg="{ \"body\" : \"$commitmsg\" }"
    echo $jiramsg > /tmp/jiramsg.txt
    curl -u gogs:gogs -X POST --data $jiramsg -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://172.17.0.1:8080/rest/api/latest/issue/SNACK-17/comment
done
```
