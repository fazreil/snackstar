# Running jira software
We are going to run jira out of jira-software docker image provided by atlassian <sup>1</sup>.

run the command below to create a jira instance

```
docker volume create --name jiraVolume
docker run -v jiraVolume:/var/atlassian/application-data/jira --name="jira" -d -p 8080:8080 atlassian/jira-software
```

# Running gogs
We are going to run gogs out of gogs docker image provided by gogs <sup>2</sup>

```
docker volume create --name gogsVolume
docker run -v gogsVolume:/data --name=gogs -p 10022:22 -p 10080:3000 -d gogs/gogs
```

# Create gogs user in jira
For now let's call this guy 'gogs'

# Create an issue
Create an issue (task issuetype) and take a look at the issue key.
When I create it, it is called 'SNACK-17'

# Test calling JIRA Rest API
this is the form of curl command to call jira rest api to update comment on SNACK-17. Reference can be found at <sup>3</sup>
```
curl -u gogs:gogs -X POST --data '{ "body" : "test" }' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8080/rest/api/latest/issue/SNACK-17/comment
```
Look at the form of the address, there are:
- rest api module (.../issue/...)
- followed by issue key (.../SNACK-17/...)
- followed by the function name (.../comment)

there is `--data` part where you supply the body of string you like to comment with

the `-u gogs:gogs` specify the authentication to jira in form of `username:password`

# modify git hook to call JIRA Rest API
(todo)

# Testing curl to update jira comment
testing
